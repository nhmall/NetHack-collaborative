There are features that some would like to see improved or added in
NetHack and we agree with several of them. Sometimes they need testing
and further refinement. Sometimes they require porting to multiple
platforms or windowing systems.

For example, core game features that impact the "*window-port*"
interface may need to be adapted for each of the following:

-   tty
-   curses
-   Windows graphical interface
-   X11
-   Qt 5 or greater
-   DOS

Typically, code needs to be adapted to work on the following platforms :
-   Linux
-   MacOS
-   Windows
-   DOS

Code that results from these collaborations is intended to eventually
be merged into the upstream NetHack repository.
